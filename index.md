Currently learning and experimenting with back-end software engineering for optimizations, analytics ,performance tuning and scalability. Open to back-end engineering roles!

Long term goals that I want to explore deeply & work upon in any small possible ways -- Sci-tech(frequency & electromagnetic engineering, cellular communication,healing speed improvements)

Back-end Engineering Experience via projects â€” 5.2 months till June mid 2025 + still learning.
Previous 5 months of experience in fronted software engineering via projects(2022) .
ML exploration (4 months part time(2024) )
